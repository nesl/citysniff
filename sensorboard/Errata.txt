This file is an errata for the CitySniff sensorboard. It will describe
necessary hardware changes, as well as explain some of the calibration
resistors that need to be changed in case of differences in the O3
sensor or microphone sensitivity.

Microphone
==========
R33 and R32 are two resistors to set the gain on the audio amplifier.
For the current version, we needed to put them to the highest values,
i.e., R33=175kOhm, R32=5kOhm.

Additionally we removed C34, shorted R32, and replaced R30=10kOhm (not
    sure?)


O3 Sensor
=========
To get the O3 sensor to work better, I needed to recalculate the value
for R20, since the minimum resistance of the sensor is <50kOhm. After
some tests, I found that Rs=17.14kOhm. Thus, I choosing R20=21.1kOhm
should scale the maximum voltage to 2.5 Volt.

To calculate, measure Vout_1 (on pin 6 of U6) and Vin_1+ (on pin 3 of
    U6):
Rs = R20/(Vout_1-Vin_1+)

Then, use

R20 = (Vout_1Max/Vin_1+ - 1) * Rs

Note that Rs is on pin 4 on JP9, R_H on pin 3 of JP9.


MSP430 patch wires
==================

Some of the pins were shared and thus needed to be replaced. The signals
are now as follows:

ENABLE_MIC moved to P5.0 (pin 44)
ENABLE_MSG moved to P5.3 (pin 47)
